This program calculates the minimum number of steps required to make two arrays equal eithe by adding, subtracting etc, something at various indexes.
ex:- 
In Array Set 1 i.e. 
M = { 3, 7, 1, 4, 1, 2 };
N = { 3, 7, 3, 6, 3, 2 };

We can add 2 at index 2, 3 and 4 in array M which will make it equal to array N or we can subtract 2 from same indexes in array N to make it equal to array M,
So we just used one number "2" and did one operation (+ or -) at selected indexes to make arrays equal which is countes as one step.

So in above array minimum no of steps required to make it equal will be 1.
